Introduction
-----

The Arduino has many uses, one of the more popular uses is with temperature sensors. For this the Dallas Onewire DS18B20 is most used. In this example we use this onewire chip and make a sketch for reading the temperature.

With this sensor you can get the temperature in your room, car, whatever. 

Product
-----
As in the past the temperature sensor output is analog, we need to add additional A / D And D / A chip into Line conversion, for Arduino resources are not abundant external interface is a big challenge at the same time Utilization is not high. The new DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Module is a good solution for this, it use a unique bus line and economic package that make this sensor a good DIY component, 

Specifications
-----
1. The module uses a single-bus digital temperature sensor DS18B20, the external power supply voltage Range is 3.0 V to 5.5 V, No standby power. Measurement temperature range of -55 ° C to +125 ℃, Fahrenheit equivalent 67 ° F to 257 ° F, -10 °C to +85 ° C range accuracy of ± 0.5 ° C.
2. The temperature sensor is a programmable resolution of 9 to 12 temperature conversion to 12-bit digital format With a maximum of 750 milliseconds formula User definable nonvolatile temperature alarm settings.
3. Each DS18B20 contains a unique serial number, can be with a plurality ds18b20s Exists in a bus. Temperature sensor can be placed at different places in the detected temperature.

Notes
------
1. The DS18B20 and ordinary transistors look similiar, so be careful not to regard it as a generalPass transistor to avoid damage
2. In order to prevent damage to the DS18B20 ensure that the powerLine and ground are not reversed.
3. The relevant technical data on the bus did not mention a single number that can be linked to how much DS18B20, But in practical applications are not as many, and we should pay attention to. 
4. There is a bus length limitation that should be taken in consideration when long-distance communications, consider bus distributed capacitance and resistance.
5. Identify DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Module power line, ground, and data Line, power line and ground points connect to the Arduino test board +5 V, GND, Data bus connect to the digital port.

Raspberry Pi 2
-----
Note about raspberry test: both 5v and 3.3v setup as described around the links below are working. when i was testing with my finger to elevate temperature, the ds18B20 stop working after few measure. It seems to be dead and not viewable from the pi. After waiting a little bit, i powered off and on the pi and the sensor start to answer again. It's perhaps it is a cheap module and the elevation speed too fast ?.

Preparation
-----
+ Arduino controller × 1
+ DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Module × 1
+ USB data cable × 1
+ download and install the OneWire libary

Connecting
-----
+ Pin - = connect to Arduino GND
+ Pin (middel) = connect to arduino +5V
+ Pin S = Signal, in this example connect to Arduino Digital port 10

When everything is properly connected, there is a led on the module that blinks when the sensor is read.

#### For arduino


    #include <OneWire.h>
 
    // DS18S20 Temperature chip i/o
    OneWire ds(10);  // on pin 10
 
    void setup(void) {
    // initialize inputs/outputs
    // start serial port
    Serial.begin(9600);
    }
 
    void loop(void) {

    int HighByte, LowByte, TReading, SignBit, Tc_100, Whole, Fract;

    byte data[12];
    byte addr[8];
 
    if ( !ds.search(addr)) {
      Serial.print("No more addresses.\n");

    ds.select(addr);
    ds.write(0x44,1);         // start conversion, with parasite power on at the end
 
    delay(1000);     // maybe 750ms is enough, maybe not
    // we might do a ds.depower() here, but the reset will take care of it.
 
    present = ds.reset();
    ds.select(addr);

    LowByte = data[0];
    HighByte = data[1];
    TReading = (HighByte << 8) + LowByte;
    SignBit = TReading & 0x8000;  // test most sig bit
    if (SignBit) // negative

        TReading = (TReading ^ 0xffff) + 1; // 2's comp
    }
    Tc_100 = (6 * TReading) + TReading / 4;    // multiply by (100 * 0.0625) or 6.25
 
    Whole = Tc_100 / 100;  // separate off the whole and fractional portions
    Fract = Tc_100 % 100;

    {
        Serial.print("-");
    }
    Serial.print(Whole);

#### For raspberry pi 2
setting up gpio:

First edit /boot/config.txt find dtoverlay and replace with dtoverlay=w1-gpio

save and reboot

after reboot execute:

1. sudo modprobe w1-gpio
2. sudo modprobe w1_therm
3. ls -l /sys/bus/w1/devices/

from the output of the ls command, write down the unique number of your DS18B20 (like: 28-000006dfa76c)

write a python script like this one:
    #original script from http://www.instructables.com/id/Read-temperature-with-DS18B20-Raspberry-Pi-2/?ALLSTEPS#intro
    #comments added by jjguazzo
 
    import time
 
    try:
        while True:
                #replace the value (28-000006dfa76c) below with yours 
                tempfile = open("/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-000006dfa76c/w1_slave")
                #read the current temperature from DS18B20 
                thetext = tempfile.read()
                tempfile.close()
                #clean the raw data
                tempdata = thetext.split("\n")[1].split(" ")[9]
                temperature = float(tempdata[2:])
                temperature = temperature / 1000
                #display the temperature
                print temperature
                #wait 1 second before next read
                time.sleep(1)
 
    #prevent the running script to stop except if you press Ctrl+C
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
run and have fun !
