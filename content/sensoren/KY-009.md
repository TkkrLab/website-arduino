 
Overview
-----

SMD RGB LED module consists of a full-color LED made by R, G, B three pin PWM voltage input can be adjusted. Primary colors (red / blue / green) strength in order to achieve full color mixing effect. Control of the module with the Arduino can be achieved Cool lighting effects.


Specifications
-----
1.  Using 5050 full color LED with max current of 20mA
Forward Voltage : Red 1.80V (2.4 max), Green,Blue 2.8V (3.6V) 
2.  RGB trichromatic limiting resistor to prevent burnout
3.  Through the PWM adjusting three primary colors can be mixed to obtain different colors
4.  With a variety of single-chip interface
5.  Operating voltage: 5V
6.  LED drive mode: common cathode driver

Schema
-----
Since you can't connect the led's directly to the Arduino you will need resistors!!

+   Arduino pin 9 --> 180 Ohm resistor --> Pin 'R' of KY-009 module
+   Arduino pin 10 --> 100 Ohm resistor --> Pin 'G' of KY-009 module
+   Arduino pin 11 --> 100 Ohm resistor --> Pin 'B' of KY-009 module
+   Arduino GND --> pin '-' of KY-009 module 

Example Code

    int redpin = 11; // select the pin for the red LED
    int bluepin = 10; // select the pin for the blue LED
    int greenpin = 9; // select the pin for the green LED
    int val=0;
    void setup () {
        pinMode (redpin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode (bluepin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode (greenpin, OUTPUT);
        Serial.begin (9600);
    }
 
    void loop () {
    for (val=255; val>0; val--)
    {
    analogWrite (redpin, val);
    analogWrite (bluepin, 255-val);
    analogWrite (greenpin, 128-val);
    delay (1);
    }
    for (val = 0; val <255; val++)
    {
    analogWrite (redpin, val);
    analogWrite (bluepin, 255-val);
    analogWrite (greenpin, 128-val);
    delay (1);
    }
    Serial.println (val, DEC);
    }
