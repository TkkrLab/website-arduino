KEYES ARDUINO laser transmitter module
-----
Laser transmitter module, 650 nm (red), gives a small intens beam. Take care of your eyes, do not look direct into the beam.

Power consumption: 30 mA at 5 V

Pin layout
-----
The module is labeled wrong, see below !!

+   Pin - = GND
+   Pin (middle pin) = not connected
+   Pin S = +5V


Routines source code:

    void setup ()
    {
    pinMode (13, OUTPUT); // define the digital output interface 13 feet
    }
    void loop () {
    digitalWrite (13, HIGH); // open the laser head
    delay (1000); // delay one second
    digitalWrite (13, LOW); // turn off the laser head
    delay (1000); // delay one second
    }
