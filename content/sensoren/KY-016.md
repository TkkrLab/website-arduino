Overview
----
RGB LED module consists of a plug-in full color LED made by R, G, B three pin PWM voltage input can be adjusted Section three primary colors (red / blue / green) strength in order to achieve full color mixing effect. Control of the module with the Arduino can be achieved Cool lighting effects.

Specifications
----
* the use of plug-in full-color LED
* RGB trichromatic limiting resistor to prevent burnout
* through the PWM adjusting three primary colors can be mixed to obtain different colors
* with a variety of single-chip interface
* the working voltage: 5V
* LED drive mode: common cathode driver


Schematic
----
* Arduino pin 11 --> Pin R module
* Arduino pin 10 --> Pin G module
* Arduino pin 9 --> Pin B module
* Arduino pin GND --> Pin - module

You don't need any resistors, these are already included on the module.

Example code
----
	//KY016 3-color LED module
	int redpin = 11; // select the pin for the red LED
	int bluepin = 10; // select the pin for the blue LED
	int greenpin = 9 ;// select the pin for the green LED
	int val;
	
	void setup () {
	  pinMode (redpin, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode (bluepin, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode (greenpin, OUTPUT);
	  Serial.begin (9600);
	}

	void loop ()
	{
	  for (val = 255; val> 0; val --)
	  {
	    analogWrite (11, val);
	    analogWrite (10, 255-val);
	    analogWrite (9, 128-val);
	    delay (10);
	    Serial.println (val, DEC);
	  }
	  for (val = 0; val <255; val ++)
	  {
	    analogWrite (11, val);
	    analogWrite (10, 255-val);
	    analogWrite (9, 128-val);
	    delay (10);
	    Serial.println (val, DEC);
	  }
	}
